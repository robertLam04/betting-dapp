# Reaction Time Betting DApp

## Description

Decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to wager Ether (ETH) on their ability to achieve a certain reaction time. The DApp is implemented using Solidity for the smart contract, Ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum network, and React.js with Vite for the front end. The development and testing environment is set up using Hardhat.

## Purpose

To learn more about blockchain technology and writing smart contracts while simultanously practicing front-end development with react.
